# 3D-Tower-Defence
A 3D tower defence prototype created in Unity game engine as a proof of concept.
This prototype only exists to demonstrate a concept and does not function like an actual game.  Due to the absence of Rigidbodies, objects are moved with respect to their transforms which would be improper practice in a project for a real game, and the prototype has no means of handling collisions between projectiles and enemies.
